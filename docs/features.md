## What is Tabahi Console

Tabahi Console is a Web-to-IoT interface to manage and remote control your programmable IoT devices. Using Tabahi Console, you can:

* Push data to the server and view it as tables and graphs.
* Add/Edit variables on the web that are synced to the device. You can turn on remote switches through the web.
* Set telegram notification for any variable value change.
* You can run scripts on the server to avoid overloading small devices with heavy computing.
* Easily send messages from one device to another without a direct link between them.
* Check the weather forecast and sun timings.
* View device activity on the UDP monitor to debug it (similar to Serial Monitor).
* Over-the-Air (OTA) updates for ESP32 and ESP8266.
